# Design (10 pts)

## Low Level Design

- [OOP](https://github.com/mhackersu/ninety-nine-bottles-js)
- UML
- Schema Design
- Architecture
  - Microservices
    - [Sidecar](https://github.com/fostercs/JS101/blob/main/design-patterns/structural/sidecar-pattern-structural-declarative.md) - The Sidecar pattern is used to augment the functionality of a microservice by running additional processes or services in the same deployment unit (like a container or pod). This allows for modularization of concerns such as logging, monitoring, configuration, and communication.
- Design Principles (SOLID, Gang of Four)
- SOLID
- GoF
- Orthogonally - A concept where components or systems are designed in such a way that changes in one do not affect others. It emphasizes minimizing dependencies between components to increase modularity and reduce the risk of side effects.
  - Dependency Management
  - Inversion of Control (IoC)
  - [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/fostercs/JS101/blob/main/design-patterns/creational/dependency-injection-creational-imperative-declara) - Dependency Injection promotes orthogonality by reducing the dependencies between components. By injecting dependencies into a class rather than having the class instantiate them itself, DI decouples the class from its dependencies, making it easier to change one without affecting the other. This promotes a more modular and maintainable system, which aligns with the principles of orthogonality.
