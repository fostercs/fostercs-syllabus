1. **Algorithm**: A set of rules or steps for solving a problem or performing a task in computing.
2. **Data Structure**: A specialized format for organizing and storing data.
3. **Database**: An organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically.
4. **Hashing**: The process of converting an input (or 'key') into a fixed-size string of bytes.
5. **Cache**: A hardware or software component that stores data so future requests can be served faster.
6. **Big O Notation**: A mathematical notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
7. **Scrum**: An Agile framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on software development.
8. **Sprints**: A set period during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review in Agile methodology.
9. **Backlog**: A list of tasks or features that are prioritized and need to be worked on in the future.
10. **Stakeholder**: Any individual or group with an interest in the success and outcomes of a project.
11. **Refactoring**: The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.
12. **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
13. **Concurrency**: The ability of different parts or units of a program to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.
14. **Parallelism**: The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes.
15. **Profiling**: The process of measuring the space (memory) or time complexity of a program.
16. **Load Balancing**: The process of distributing workloads across multiple computing resources to ensure no single resource is overwhelmed.
17. **Scalability**: The capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
18. **Unit Testing**: A software testing method where individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
19. **Continuous Integration**: The practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
20. **Version Control**: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.
